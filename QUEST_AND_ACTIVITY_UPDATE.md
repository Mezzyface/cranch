## üß™ Suggested Progression

1. **Early Game**: Basic training (+50 per stat)
2. **Mid Game**: Advanced training (+75/-15 trade-offs)
3. **Late Game**: Extreme training (+100/+50 over 2 weeks)

### Training Strategy Examples

**For Guard Robot (Tank)**:
- Use Power Training to maximize strength
- Use Rest & Recovery to maintain other stats

**For Neon Bat (Speedster)**:
- Use Speed Training to maximize agility
- Avoid Power Training (would reduce speed)

**For Krip (Balanced)**:
- Use Balanced Training or Rest & Recovery
- Avoid specialized training with penalties
